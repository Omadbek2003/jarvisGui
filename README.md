My main purpose is making desktop application like Jarvis of Ironman that can used to manage your computer
ranging from setting timers to do some kind of work, to writing code automatically with your voice. Therefore, 
I can also call it as new super project by Uzbek coders of INHA university in Tashkent. Now, it's written with 
python and its super libraries like opencv and speech-recognition. However, in the near future we will learn 
AI(Artificial Intelligence) and Web Development fully and then we will complete it fully and show you full 
updated version of Jarvis application of desktop.
